#Full Stack Nanodegree Project 4 Design-A-Game

## Set-Up Instructions:
1.  Update the value of application in app.yaml to the app ID you have registered
 in the App Engine admin console and would like to use to host your instance of this sample.
1.  Run the app with the devserver using dev_appserver.py DIR, and ensure it's
 running by visiting the API Explorer - by default localhost:8080/_ah/api/explorer.
1.  (Optional) Generate your client library(ies) with the endpoints tool.
 Deploy your application.
 
 
 
##Game Description:
Hangman is a simple word guessing game. Each game begins with a random 'target'
word, which is chosen from a predefined list of words. The player must make individual guesses, 
as to the letters contained in this 'target' word, which are registered as 'attempts'. 
'Guesses' are sent to the `make_move` endpoint which will reply
with either: 'Letter already guessed!', 'That letter is in the target word!',
'That letter is not in the target word!', 'You guessed the correct word!', or 'game over' (if the maximum
number of attempts is reached).
Many different Hangman games can be played by many different Users at any
given time. Each game can be retrieved or played by using the path parameter
`urlsafe_game_key`.
